    0:00-0:25 HOOK: The Problem
    | Scene | Visual | Voiceover |
    |-------|--------|-----------|
    | Intro | Dark screen, text appears: "What if students could BUILD their own experiments just by talking to an AI?" | What if students could create interactive science experiments just by... asking? |
    | Problem Montage | Quick cuts: bored students, textbooks, confused faces, static diagrams | Traditional STEM education is stuck in the past. Static content. Passive learning. Kids who can't visualize abstract concepts. |
    | Transition | Bright flash, FableLab logo animates in | But what if you could change that? Meet FableLab. |

    | Voice Input | User clicks microphone, speaks: "Now add gravity and make the balls colorful" | Talk to it. No typing needed. |
    | Real-Time Evolution | As user speaks, a NEW node appears connected to the first. Animation now has gravity + rainbow colors | It understands. It evolves. And it keeps the history—so you can always go back. |
    | Screen Share | "Share Screen" button clicked → agent sees user's code → chat: "I see you're working on collision detection. Let me optimize that..." | It can SEE what you're doing. Screen share lets the AI tutor you in real-time. |
    | Webcam | "Enable Camera" → user holds up a hand-drawn sketch → AI: "I'll turn your drawing into a simulation" → creates particle system | Even your sketches become experiments. |
    | Multi-Select Context | User Shift+clicks 3 nodes → types "Compare these approaches" → AI explains differences | Select multiple experiments and the AI understands the relationships. Context-aware intelligence. |
    | Rapid Fire Demo | Fast montage: 5 more experiments created in 20 seconds - pendulum, wave simulation, swarm behavior, fractal tree, solar system | Bounce between ideas instantly. Physics, art, math—anything. |
    | Evolution Tree | Camera pulls back: shows 10+ nodes connected in a beautiful evolution tree | Build entire families of experiments. See how ideas evolve. |
    | Tech Mention | Graphic: "Real-Time WebSocket | Gemini ADK | p5.js | React Flow" | Powered by real-time AI communication. This is the future of hands-on learning. |
